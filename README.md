## HTML title changed
The title of my web app is called "Relationship form". 


## Description of my app
It is a application designed for each family. The app includes my name, my mom and dad's name. 
When people create the post, the app will ask them to input their own name, and their mother and father's name. Then, they can add any message they want. For example, people write "They are my parents." or "They are the most important people all over the world for me.". etc. After they click "Post", the app will generate and post their information on the "All posts" page with the time of when they input. 
If people want to update the information they input, they can click the "Edit" button under their post and update whatever they want and then click "Save".
If people want to delete the post, they can simply click the "Delete" button under their post.
